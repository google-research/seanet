<i>"Made early in his career, Matisse s Dance, 1910, shows a group of red dancers caught in a collective moment of innocent freedom and joy, holding hands as they whirl around in space. Simple and direct, the painting speaks volumes about our deep-rooted, primal human desire for connection, movement, rhythm and music."</i> By <a href="https://www.thecollector.com/behind-matisse-dance-painting/"> thecollector.com </a>
