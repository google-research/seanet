<i>"Inspired by a hallucinatory experience in which Munch felt and heard a scream throughout nature, it depicts a panic-stricken creature, simultaneously corpse like and reminiscent of a sperm or fetus, whose contours are echoed in the swirling lines of the blood-red sky."</i> By <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Scream-by-Munch">Zaczek, Iain. "The Scream". Encyclopedia Britannica, 14 Apr. 2022</a>.
