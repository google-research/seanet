<i>"The grey, black, and white painting, on a canvas 3.49 meters tall and 7.76 meters across, portrays the suffering wrought by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames."</i> By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(Picasso)">wikipedia</a>
