I've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar. | What kind of guitar do you have in mind? | Um I'm not sure, I guess I'd uh like to learn to play both acoustic and electric. | Yeah, that's a great idea. Both types of guitars have their own uh their own unique sounds and uh and playing styles. | I know, but uh it's hard to decide which one to start with. | Well, um if you're not sure, I would recommend starting with an acoustic guitar. | Interesting | They're a little easier to learn on | ah | and they can be played anywhere. | That's good to know.
