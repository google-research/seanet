I didn't sleep well last night. | Oh, no. What happened? | I don't know. I I just couldn't seem to uh to fall asleep somehow, I kept tossing and turning all night. | That's too bad. Maybe you should uh try going to bed earlier tonight or uh maybe you could try reading a book. | Yeah, thanks for the suggestions, I hope you're right. | No problem. I I hope you get a good night's sleep.
